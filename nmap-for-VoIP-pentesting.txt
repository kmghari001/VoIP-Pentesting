nmap scripts for VoIP analyses
Posted on September 3, 2011 by Fabian Affolter
The standard installation of nmap on Fedora contains already plenty of scripts which can be used with NSE.
All scripts are located at /usr/share/nmap/scripts.
The first step is to add SIP support for nmap. Switch to the nselib directory and download the dependencies for sip-brute.

1	cd /usr/share/nmap/nselib
2	sudo wg et http://nmap.org/svn/nselib/sip.lua
3	sudo wg et http://nmap.org/svn/nselib/creds.lua
The same with sip-brute but sip-brute goes to another directory.

1	cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts
2	sudo wg et http://nmap.org/svn/scripts/sip-brute.nse
The last step is to update the plugin database of nmap.

1	sudo nmap --script-updatedb
2	Starting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2011-09-03 10:40 CEST
3	NSE: Updating rule database.
4	NSE: Script Database updated successfully.
5	Nmap done: 0 IP addresses (0 hosts up) scanned in 0.35 seconds
Letâ€™s run nmap against the server.

1	sudo nmap -sU -p 5060 10.0.0.12 --script=sip-brute
2	 
3	Starting Nmap 5.51 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2012-09-03 10:41 CEST
